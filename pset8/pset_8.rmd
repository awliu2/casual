8. (0.5 p) The fundamental problem of causal inference.

3:10 

9. (0.5 p) That random control trials (RCTs) ensure balance.

4:19

10. (0.5 p) Observational studies and the problem of confounders.

4:37 

11. (0.5 p) Rubin’s Potential Outcome Model also called Rubin Causal Model (RCM).

8:02

12. (0.5 p) The NSW experiment. Note: you used this data in several PSets.

10:17

13. (0.5 p) The “observational” data constructed by combining the NSW experimental sample with a control sample taken from survey data such as PSID. Note: You used this data in several PSets.

10:38

14. (0.5 p) Matching and propensity score method. Note: You applied these methods in several PSets.

11:50

15. (0.5 p) The 2001 Imbens, Rubin, Sacerdote’s Lottery paper. Note: We discuss this paper in CAUS 3.pdf.

12:42

16. (0.5 p) The difference in differences (DD) estimation method.

26:09

17. (0.5 p) Void. Note: This half point is assigned to everybody by default.
